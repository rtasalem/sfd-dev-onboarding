## Welcome to the Single Front Door Development Team
This guide is for new software developers (at any level) joining the Single Front Door (SFD) within Defra's FCP. These instructions are specific to getting your local development set up and ready so that new devs can get involved in building cool stuff as soon as possible. First and foremost, if you have any questions then just ask anyone on the dev team. We're pretty big believers in "there's no such thing as a stupid question".
