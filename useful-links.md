# Useful Links
Below is a list of links that are useful to onboarding new software developers to the SFD team. Most of these are mentioned throughout the guide, some are not but will be useful to have regardless.
- [ffc-sfd-core](https://github.com/defra/ffc-sfd-core): For making local development easier.
- [ffc-azure-service-bus-scripts](https://github.com/defra/ffc-azure-service-bus-scripts): For provisioning Azure Service Bus infrastructure to be used for local development.
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq): A lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON, and XML processor. Needed to run commands from the [ffc-azure-service-bus-scripts](https://github.com/defra/ffc-azure-service-bus-scripts) repository.
- [Defra ID Test Data](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VVAHWR/pages/4329538112/DEFRA+ID+Test+Data): Mock CRNs and passwords that can be used for signing into the SFD via Defra Identity when `DEFRA_ID_ENABLED` is set to `true`.
- [Single Front Door Kanban Board](https://dev.azure.com/defragovuk/DEFRA-FFC/_boards/board/t/Single%20Front%20Door/Stories?System.Tags=SFD%20Tech%2CTech): This is our ADO Kanban board where we keep track of all our tickets. The link will show you the board filtered by the `Tech` and `SFD Tech` tags (i.e. only showing tickets related to software development on the SFD). Whenever you create a new ticket, you'll need to tag it with the profession: `SFD Tech` (`Tech` is an older tag that is no longer used).
- [ADP Observations](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SFI/pages/4748410950/ADP+Observations): A Confluence page dedicated to the adoption of the ADP (Azure Development Platform) by SFD. Here we list observations that we wish to bring to ADP's attention as a consistent way of providing them feedback.
- [ADP Portal](https://portal.adp.defra.gov.uk/): This is the ADP portal where you'll be able to create frontend and backend microservices, and check that the deployment of services to different environments are healthy. When you join the team, you may not have access to the portal. If so, let the dev team know and we will ask ADP to grant you access.
- [Single Front Door Development Confluence pages](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SFI/pages/4660625764/Single+Front+Door): This is where we keep all of our development/technical write ups. Here you'll find information relating to previous spikes, instructions for creating frontend and backend services on ADP, a list of all the ports we use for local development etc.
- [FCP Single Front Door Confluence](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SFD/overview?homepageId=4930699693): This is a separate Confluence space dedicated to everything related to SFD (it's worth noting that at some stage our dev Confluence pages from the previous link may be moved to this space).
